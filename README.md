This is the repo for the paper "[InfiGUI-R1: Advancing Multimodal GUI Agents from Reactive Actors to Deliberative Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14239)". In this work, we develop **InfiGUI-R1**, a multimodal large language model-based GUI agent primarily trained using **Reinforcement Learning** to enhance planning and error recovery skills for GUI tasks. Specifically, our agent is trained using a two-stage framework: first, we inject spatial reasoning capabilities by distilling reasoning trajectories from teacher models; second, we enhance the agent's planning and error recovery skills using Reinforcement Learning, employing techniques like rewarding accurate sub-goal generation and training on constructed error recovery scenarios.
